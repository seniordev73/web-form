			/**
			 * **PORTING NOTES**
			 *
			 * The first test is directly ported from JavaRosa. The comment below,
			 * also ported from JavaRosa, was initially surprising! Glancing at the
			 * {@link https://github.com/getodk/javarosa/pull/698 | pull request}
			 * which added the test:
			 *
			 * 1. The test originally exercised the expected behavior, and was ignored
			 *    because it failed.
			 *
			 * 2. PR feedback requested the test document existing behavior, with a
			 *    comment explaining that the behavior does not match expectations.
			 *
			 * It appears that JUnit does not have an equivalent to {@link it.fails},
			 * which we use here as an alternate approach. Absent that, it seems
			 * likely we'd end up with the same approach as JavaRosa took. But since
			 * we _do have_ this convenient mechanism to express the actual expected
			 * behavior, and to mark it failing (as we've done for many other tests
			 * ported from JavaRosa), it makes sense to reframe the test that way
			 * here.
			 *
			 * - - -
			 *
			 * Editorial: without going on a side quest to learn about any
			 * extensibility provided by JUnit, I couldn't say whether it'd be trivial
			 * to express something similar to {@link it.fails} in JavaRosa. But given
			 * the chance, I would likely apply the same logic from the linked PR
			 * above to many JavaRosa tests currently marked `@Ignore`. In general, my
			 * approach in porting these JavaRosa tests has been to strongly favor
			 * {@link it.fails} over, say, {@link it.skip} or even {@link it.todo},
			 * unless I'm absolutely sure that the test is impertinent. As with the
			 * feedback in that PR, I believe we'll benefit from knowing when behavior
			 * under test changesâ€”even when the change is possibly orthogonal to our
			 * concerns, but **especially** when the behavior becomes more consistent
			 * with our expectations.
