 * This distinction is intended to avoid confusion about the **potential** state
 * of a form's active language. A naive type to express the possibility, without
 * a synthetic default, would be something like `FormLanguage | null`, which
 * would seem to suggest to a client that a form may **only sometimes** have an
 * active languageâ€”for instance, that there might be a way for a client to turn
 * translation off and on.
 *
 * By ensuring there is always _some active language value_, and by expressing
 * the {@link FormLanguages} type to correspond to each of the possibilities
 * discussed above, it's hoped that the set of potential translation states a
 * client might encounter/establish are more clear.
