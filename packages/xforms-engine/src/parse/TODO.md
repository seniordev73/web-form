# @getodk/xforms-engine: parse

Presence of this file is intended to be temporary! It is here to signal the intent to make a clearer distinction between the parsing and runtime aspects of the engine implementation. For entirely pragmatic purposes, newly introduced will be added here to start. We can decide in review if we want to move the rest into this directory right away. (For existing/untouched code, this would just mean moving the files and updating imports to reflect that. Small effort, lots of potential diff noise.)
